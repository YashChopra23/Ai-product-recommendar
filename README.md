# AI-Driven Product Recommendation Web App

[cite_start]This is a full-stack application built for a 2-day project assignment[cite: 2]. [cite_start]It provides AI-powered furniture recommendations based on semantic search and generates creative product descriptions using Generative AI[cite: 5]. [cite_start]The application features a main recommendation "chat" page and a separate analytics page[cite: 7, 8].

## Features

* [cite_start]**Semantic Recommendation:** Uses a `SentenceTransformer` model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to create text embeddings, which are stored in a **Pinecone** vector database[cite: 32]. This allows for powerful, meaning-based search rather than just keyword matching.
* [cite_start]**Generative AI:** Integrates with the **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-2.5-flash`) to generate unique, creative product descriptions for each recommended item[cite: 31]. Includes a fallback to a mock description if the API quota is exceeded.
* [cite_start]**Data Analytics:** A separate analytics page that displays visualizations (created with Matplotlib/Seaborn) from the product dataset[cite: 36], including price distribution, top brands, and top categories.
* [cite_start]**Full-Stack Architecture:** Built with a **React** frontend [cite: 6] [cite_start]and a **FastAPI** backend[cite: 6], with the two communicating via REST API calls.
* [cite_start]**CV Prototyping:** Includes a notebook demonstrating the ability to load a **CLIP model** (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`) to generate image embeddings, fulfilling the CV requirement[cite: 30, 44].

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pinecone, SentenceTransformers, Google Generative AI, Pandas
* **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios, CSS
* **Notebooks:** Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Transformers, PyTorch

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js (which includes npm)
* A (free) **Pinecone** API Key
* A (free) **Google AI (Gemini)** API Key

### 2. Backend Setup

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # (Or use the 'yashenv' you've already created)
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install "fastapi[all]" uvicorn pandas scikit-learn
    pip install pinecone sentence-transformers google-generativeai python-dotenv
    pip install transformers torch Pillow requests matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    * In the root of the project (e.g., `Ikarus/`), create a file named `.env`.
    * Add your secret API keys to this file:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"
        PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key_here"
        ```

4.  **Populate the Vector Database:**
    * Before running the app, you must populate the Pinecone database.
    * Open your main Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `model_prototyping.ipynb`).
    * Run the cells that correspond to **Step 5.3: Create and Populate Pinecone Vector DB**. This will embed your products and upload them.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node Modules:**
    (This will install React, React Router, Axios, etc.)
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Move Analytics Plots:**
    * Move or copy the `analytics_plots` folder (generated by your notebook) into the `frontend/public/` directory.
    * The final path should be `frontend/public/analytics_plots/price_distribution.png`.

## How to Run the Application

You must have **two terminals** open to run this project.

### Terminal 1: Run the Backend (FastAPI)

1.  Activate your Python environment (e.g., `.\yashenv\Scripts\activate`).
2.  Navigate to the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
4.  The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Terminal 2: Run the Frontend (React)

1.  Navigate to the frontend folder:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Start the React app:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3.  Your default browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.
